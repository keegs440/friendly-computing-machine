## Sir Richard McBrecht
*Scene: A man possessing animated energy belying the thick white hair on his head, enters from the right wearing proper chic early 20th-century British colonial attire. A second, identically dressed white-haired man enters from the left. They address each other while facing out to the audience at that nearly-shouting pitch of early “talky” cinema.*

RICH: The crying need of the day is more faith and optimism. You wait: one day you may see a man wielding a pick and shovel and the next day in charge of a business of his own. 

DICK: All I can see are hundreds of acres of wonderfully valuable land overgrown with noxious weeds. 

RICH: But you said it yourself: that piece of ground is worth so much money. Those are choice lands of illimitable resources.

DICK: Well, if I could settle this matter by some process of magic, I would have done so long ago.

RICH: You haven’t heard? The latch string is out as far as British Columbia is concerned. Come in and help yourselves.

DICK: In all my life, I have not had quite so much to be thankful for. [pauses] But what about… them?

RICH: We in British Columbia have always lived side by side, happily and as friends. They will learn to appreciate the meaning of the British Flag and all that it stands for in the way of protection and justice.

DICK: They really have no reason to believe that they have been treated unjustly.

*They shake hands vigorously, and continuously. WANG, the railway worker, enters playing a flute, then pauses to sing:*

>Now it’s all very well for these paid politicians.  
>And affluent holders of party positions;  
>From the struggle for bread they’re entirely immune;  
>While we pay the piper, and they call the tune.  

*Additional instruments join, as do RICH and DICK, in hearty repetition.*
