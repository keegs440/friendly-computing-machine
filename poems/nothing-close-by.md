## nothing close by

just a standard monsoon  
but not for me  
nothing to do but look at the green ocean  
reflecting on my life  
the one relationship without closure  

this has never happened before  
caught on a cliff wall  
under attack  
screaming, swearing  
at the very top top  
like you’re on the moon  

venture  
into the jungle  
mind yourself  
follow the rules  
finally, eventually get to the wrong place  

it’s a dump  
but looks like a circus  
orcas putting on a show  
five seconds later  
an overlimit halibut  

it was June  

clubbed it to death  
as one does  
so fresh and delicious  
staring, no expression  

the second group stopped to help  
they realized we were struggling  
very fragile, nothing close by  
convinced we were gonna sink  
twenty flights of narrow, steep steps  
fell off quite a few  
we made it, though
