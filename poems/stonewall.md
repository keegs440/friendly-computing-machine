## Stonewall


On June 28, 1969  
The homos of Stonewall Inn stood in a line.  
They synced up their kicks, and shook their long hair,  
Tired of being told what they ought not to wear.  

At this time all the gay bars were owned by the Mafia,  
Who profited more from the cash they got off ya  
Than the illegal liquor sales they offered to queers,  
Who were only too happy to clink their mugs ‘Cheers’.  

Every month corrupt cops would tip off the bar,  
Backup liquor would be stored in a car, not too far,  
So the joint could get juked up again without waiting  
Never mind that the fags seemed to be… anticipating.  

The lights would come on and the hands that were holding  
Would let go, and eyes would dart up to the mouldings  
Avoiding the glare of the cops as they entered,  
Knowing on whom their attention was centered.  

Men in drag they arrested barely hiding their loathing  
And women in fewer than three pieces of ‘feminine’ clothing  
Female officers corralled queens in the women’s commode  
Told ‘em, “Pull down those drawers: If you’re fem, then I’ll know.”  

But they knew every time the police came to raid  
If they kept their heads down the right men would be paid.  
If a few were arrested it was hardly alarming —  
While a night spent in jail might not be all that charming,  
As long as your picture didn’t get in the news  
You’d be back at the Stonewall Inn, sipping your booze  
With your guys and your gals, and your reach-around pals.  
  
  
But this night was different, they’d squeezed ‘em too hard  
Or too often, plus the closure of several bars  
In the Village left the fairies with nowhere to fly  
So this night was the one where we'd do or we’d die:  
And maybe the loss of one Dorothy Gale  
To Oz Over-the-Rainbow was what started this tale  
But there, in the wee hours of June 28,  
(I swear, by the end, you’ll remember this date)  
The men dressed as women — and some women born men —  
Refused to be ‘verified’ right there and then:  
So the enforcers of law put them under arrest  
For no other reason than the way they were dressed.  

But instead of dispersing the dandy-crowd grew  
From of couple of dozen to a hundred or two,  
And first in good humour, teasing cops for a laugh  
Then, rather deliberately, impeding their path  
A kick-line they formed as they stared down the fuzz.  
Over their singing you could just hear the buzz  
In the air cueing impending change, within range:  

If you’d told them those faggots were ready to riot  
Not a single policeman among them would buy it.  

It began when a woman known only as “butch”  
Escaped from the grasp of the cop that was pushing  
Her, heaving her violently into his car:  
When the night-stick came down, it came down too far.  

She cried out for the crowd to do something, to act  
And they saw their community under attack  
Not just now, but forever, with no hope in sight  
Unless homos stood up for themselves on that night.  

A trans woman of colour hit a cop with her purse  
And refused to be shoved, and to make matters worse  
The crowd cheered her on, throwing pennies and beers  
Venting off all the hate they’d absorbed o’er the years.  

The cops formed a phalanx, pushing forward with clubs  
But the queens were intent on defending their pubs  
The nancy boys fanned themselves, kicking their heels  
While police drove their friends off in deflated wheels.  

And it didn’t stop that night, the rumour was out:  
More descended on Stonewall the next day to shout  
And the shouting continued, for weeks, months, and years,  
Demanding equality for all of us queers.  
  
  
I stand here today my back straightened with pride  
I’m allowed to explore my feminine side,  
And what’s more, I can marry the man of my choice:  
With the rights that we’ve won, our love can take voice  
In the same vow as you, to love ever after,  
As we homos and trans folk begin our next chapter.  

Remember, remember, on June 28,  
When the power of love took a stand against hate.
