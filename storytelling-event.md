## Storytelling Event

Six participants arrive with copies of the same hardcover book, gather around a table and exchange greetings and food items. They consult their books, note down various simple mathematical equations, and excitedly share with each other which equations they have chosen to record. A storyteller retells the end of a story from three weeks earlier. The participants debate what to do with some sundries stolen from the residence of a corrupt aristocrat. The participants ask the storyteller questions for clarification, then propose a course of action. They search for a sentient mechanical construct, and find it in a pile of garbage. A conflict ensues. The storyteller asks the participants to throw marked coloured stones on the table, and orders the participants according to which cipher is facing upwards on their stone. Participants take turns offering micro-narrations and throwing more coloured stones. One shakes fireballs out of a paintbrush and grows a third eye. Another runs up a wall and leaps down onto the construct with knives. The storyteller consults notes and charts and either accepts or denies the participantsâ€™ version of events. A non-participant serves food to the table. Someone sings a song and everyone laughs.
